Question 1:
What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized a new folder .git is created. 
The repository, however, is empty and no filder are related
to it. You have to initialized a git repository
in order to start using git, duh.

Question 3:
How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

In the staging area you can put files its changes you would
like to keep track off. Once all the files you would like to
put to one commit, you commit the changes of the files in 
the staging area. It can be regarded as an intermediate state
in order set up a commit. For example, if you finished a 
logical step containing changes in two different files, you
can use the staging area to put all the changes related to 
the logical step in the two files into one commit, as it is
recommended.

Question 4:
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the staging area to add all the files related to
complete a logical change are put to one commit.

Question 5:
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in
keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches allow to persue different routes in the developement
of the program, for example adding a new experimental feature.
